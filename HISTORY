    - ReadAHead is boolean again
    - fetching dvd infos, only if necessary (new):
	    bool UpdateBlockInfo(void);
	    void UpdateVTSInfo(void);
      else, data is cached within player.
    - Try to use ReadAHead := true,
      and check dvd drive access/performance !!

2004-06-17: Version 0.3.5-b04  
    - many merges/fixes ..
    	- highlight
	- QNX support
	- still/audio dvd's (hybrid dvd-audio)
		- dvd-v part only ..

    - pcm support started ..
      /**
       * the funny thing here is, that:
       *	- it plays well within vdr-xine
       *	- it plays broken with vdr/dvb itself (PlayVideo)
       *	- it plays broken with bitstreamout (PlayAudio)
       */

2004-06-10: Version 0.3.5-b02  
    - SPU AUTO PROBLEM:
    	 *
	#define FORCED_SUBS_ONLY_SEMANTICS
	 * this was "weak"'s solution of a forced 
	 * SPU only stream choice,
	 * which does _not_ work ..
	 *
	 * Problem:
	 *   - forcedDisplay | menu ctrseq within the SPU,
	 *     means kinda "just do it"
	 *
	 *   - special SPU channels, which only shows up
	 *     e.g. if a klingon speaks klingon,
	 *     are handled by a special SPU channel id,
	 *     which dvdnav will choose for you automatic,
	 *     and if your appropriate language is set
	 *     as the default language !
	 *   FIXME ??
	 *

    - correct pre-parse of SPU to check for forcedDisplay ctrl-seq
    	- take forceDisplay into account, if outta menu space

    - take care of all SPU channel id's [0x00 .. 0x1F]
    - take care of all Audio channel id's [0x00 .. 0x1F]

    - all SPU and Audio channels are looked up at VTS_CHANGE,
      and are therefore available if start a new title !

    - take very good care ;-), of who owns the OSD,
    	this one is needed to use softdevices, alike vdr-xine !
	*** be aware that we do need the very little patch
		patches/vdr-1.3.10_spu_01.diff
	*** to enable access to 
		- cSpuDecoder::Hide,Draw,IsVisible
		- cDvbSpuDecoder::Hide,Draw,IsVisible
	now you can switch to dvd-osd, vdr-menu and spu,
	without seg fault, or else with a softdevice ..

    - minimized dvdnav access for title string data ..

    - many stuff learned about SPU control, and channel hopping ;-)

    - please apply the mandatory patches to the regarding vanilla version:
    	- vdr-1.3.10_spu_01.diff (see above, spu stuff) 
	- vdr-xine-0.3.4-withSpu_02.diff (add dvbspu to the xineDevice)


2004-06-08: 
    - merge with inofficial fork @ dvdplugin.pimps.at ..:
	    - fixed some display errors during navigation
	    - ringbuffer implemented
	    - fixed buffer overflow in sound handling
	    - fixed language selection bug in plugin setup
	    - added 'forced subs only' mode
	    - added support for vdr >= 1.3.7, and < 1.3.7 !

2004-05-26: Version 0.3.5-b01
    - ported to vdr 1.3.8, no more support for vdr pre 1.3.8
    - added DevicePoll timeout > MAX_POLL_TOs -> DeviceClear 
    	- good for softdevices, like vdr-xine
    - added some patches for vdr 1.3.8 support ..

2003-11-18: Version 0.3.4-rc11 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - cleaned up termination (as well as UC: no disc inserted ..)
    - fixed case where device->GetSTC returns < 0 (dxr3 users)

2003-11-11: Version 0.3.4-rc10 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - fixed setting correct 16:9 / 4:3 bits in mpeg stream
    - fixed usage of DeviceClear ..
    - fixed variable osd position, regarding to video height 
    - needs vdr >= 1.2.6pre6 - no more extra STC patch !

2003-11-03: Version 0.3.4-rc9 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - bugfix: error introduced in rc8 are removed 
      (new threading errors) - menue navi is stable again.

2003-11-02: Version 0.3.4-rc8 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - bugfix: AudioSwitch had a bad thread deadlock,
              while using an audio plugin, e.g. bitstreamout.
	      After switching, audio was no more played.

2003-11-02: Version 0.3.4-rc7 .. sven at jausoft.com

    All Menue's with all sounds within Menue's should work now !
    Also any missed sync (Audio/Video/SPU) should being fixed !

    - using new sync code, with the new getSTC function
      therefore _you_have_to_ apply the patch:
	vdr-1.2.6-device-getSTC-v2.diff
      if not allready done (-> latest bitstreamout ) !!

    - the new a/v sync code does (simplified):
          delay_ticks (
		 (pktptsAudio-pktptsLastAudio)-(stcPTSAudio-stcPTSLastAudio ) )
	where pktpts is PTS of the stream
	and   stcPTS is PTS seen by the dvb device !
        therefore, we do usleep for this diff ticks we should had being passed.

    - cleaned up transition back to case where a DevicePlay/DeviceClear
      is needed (-> within Empty now )


2003-10-22: Version 0.3.4-rc6 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - added cPlayer default functions as well (AudioTrack..)
    - BITSTREAM

2003-10-14: Version 0.3.4-rc5 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - removed workarounds for vdr version < 1.2.6pre2 !

    - BITSTREAM
	- uses bitstreamout >= 0.47c

    - const int cDvdPlayer::MaxSubpStreams  = 16;
	- so hopefully 16 subtitles can be detected ..
    

2003-10-11: Version 0.3.4-rc4 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - BITSTREAM
	well, i got it to work well
	so the tee can be hot - no problem ;-)

	- made a stabilize bitstreamout-0.46g-jau01.patch,
	  read ths incl. ChangeLog !
  	  since this patch is not incl. within bitstreamout,
	  this patch is a MUST HAVE  !

	- understanding how bitstreamout works, 
 	  therefore simplifying the usage to a simple PlayAudio ;-)
	  the only difference to just PlayAudio is that we do not feed the
	  packet to another decoder ..

	- added an extra DeviceClear() at VTS_CHANGE,
	  so (especially AudioPlugins) can re-sync ..
  	  DeviceClear is called at any place it won't disturb ..
	  (manually switch track, audio, ..)

2003-10-11: Version 0.3.4-rc3 .. sven at jausoft.com
	- cleaned up Stop, no more hurting your ears on stopping plugin ;-)
		- still no audio after leaveing the plugin, any ideas ?

    	- cleaned up usage of clearSeenSubpStream(), clearSeenAudioTrack();
		- they do really clean up the lists,
		- they are called only if really intended ;-)

	- SPU fix:
		- cleared highlight button at startup (dvbspu.c)
		  bug workaround.
		  cDvbSpuDecoder::clearHighlight should set
		  hlpsize members to -1 !
		- fixed issue about:
			TV 4:3 DVD 16:9 Menu 4:3 -> cSpuDecoder::eSpuPanAndScan
		  the 16:9 flag is cleared out in this case - propper button pos. !

		- Tested with StarTrek - TheDirectorsCut - widescreeen Edition

	- BITSTREAM
		- bitstreamout plugin used only if avaiable and active
		- fixed the usage of PlayAudio -> bitstreamout,  
		  as seen in dvbplayer.c (StripAudioPackets)
			- index i was not used within "search" loop ..
	- BITSTREAM PROBLEM:
		- using the latest of all ;-)
		- bitstream out works sometimes, and sometimes not !
		- in the latter case, i have to restart vdr :-(
		- the not case:
			- other recordings running
			- previous menu struggle arround ..
			- the tee was a very hot one ;-)

	- Force DvdNavigation (-> or HowTo play DVD games ..)
		- Key 5  	DvdNavigationForce ON (not if progess display on)
		- Key Red  	Leave DvdNavigationForce
		- Assume you have a typical DVD game, so now you can
		  navigate it - see Keys above (-> README) !

			Die Monster AG, BonusMaterial.BoosDoorGame, Track #15
